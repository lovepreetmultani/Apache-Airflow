## Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows users to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and execute them on a schedule or trigger. Airflow provides a rich set of operators to perform various tasks and supports extensibility through custom operators and plugins. It is widely used for orchestrating data pipelines, ETL processes, and other complex workflows in the data engineering and data science domains.
